Zybo Z7-20-HDMI Demo
====================

Description
-----------

This project demonstrates how to use the USB-UART Bridge, HDMI Sink and HDMI Source with the ZYNQ processor. Vivado is used to build the demo's hardware platform, and Xilinx SDK is used to program the bitstream onto the board and to build and deploy a C application. Video data streams in through the HDMI in port and out through the HDMI out port. A UART interface is available to configure what is output through HDMI. The configuring options are shown in the table below.

The demo uses the usb-uart bridge to configure the HDMI Display , the Zybo Z7-20 must be connected to a computer over MicroUSB, which must be running a serial terminal. For more information on how to set up and use a serial terminal, such as Tera Term or PuTTY, refer to [this tutorial](https://reference.digilentinc.com/learn/programmable-logic/tutorials/tera-term).

Requirements
------------
* **Zybo Z7-20**: To purchase a Zybo Z7-20, see the [Digilent Store](https://store.digilentinc.com/zybo-z7-zynq-7000-arm-fpga-soc-development-board/).
* **Vivado and Vitis 2020.1 Installations**: To set up Vivado, see the [Installing Vivado, Vitis, and Digilent Board Files](https://reference.digilentinc.com/learn/programmable-logic/tutorials/2020.1/installation) tutorial on the Digilent wiki.**
* **A Terminal with access to Git: Usually preinstalled on Linux computers. The bash terminal available from https://gitforwindows.org/ is recommended for Windows users.**
* **Serial Terminal Emulator Application**: For more information see the [Installing and Using a Terminal Emulator](https://reference.digilentinc.com/learn/programmable-logic/tutorials/tera-term) guide on the Digilent wiki**.
* **MicroUSB Cable**
* **2 HDMI Cables**
* **HDMI capable Monitor/TV**

Demo Setup
----------
These steps cover what is required to open the Vitis workspace, and to program the demo onto a board.

- Clone this repository with the following command:
  
  * `git clone --recursive https://github.com/Digilent/Zybo-Z7-20-HDMI -b experimental/2020.1`
  
  * **Note:** *The --recursive flag is required as this repository uses submodules. If already cloned non-recursively, use `git submodule update --init` within the repo directory to get submodule sources.*
  
  * TODO: remove branch specifier before merge to master
- Launch Vitis 2020.1, selecting (repo)/sw/workspace as the Vitis workspace.
- In the menu at the top of the window, select *Xilinx -> XSCT Console*.
- In the console, enter the following command: `source [getws]/../scripts/create_workspace.xsct.tcl`
- Wait until the hardware platform, system project, and application project have been created from the sources present in the repository. This may take up to several minutes.
- Build everything in the workspace by pressing *Ctrl-B* or by right clicking on the *System* project in the *Assistant* pane, and selecting *Build*.
- With the board plugged in, powered on, and a serial terminal connected to its USBUART port, the demo application can be programmed onto the board by right clicking on the system project in the *Assistant* pane, and selecting *Run > SystemDebugger_hdmi_system (Launch SW Emulator)*
-

Next Steps
----------
This demo can be used as a basis for other projects by modifying the hardware platform in the Vivado project's block design or by modifying the SDK application project.
